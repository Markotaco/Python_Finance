This repository will aim to store two main analysis tools:

1.) A tool to help one generate their stock portfolio's current sharpe ratio
2.) A tool to help one generate the optimal weights of a stock portfolio based on the highest Sharpe ratio

Historical stock price data will be used as a proxy for the expected returns for a stock and the associated portfolio. Data is drawn from yfinance.
